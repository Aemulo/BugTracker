# Aemulo Bug Tracker

Welcome to the Aemulo Bug Tracker! This is a public repository dedicated to managing bugs for our main project, Aemulo. This document will guide you through the process of submitting and managing issues. 

## Getting Started

Before submitting a bug, ensure that you have the latest version of Aemulo. This will reduce the likelihood of submitting bugs that have already been fixed.

## Submitting a Bug

Follow these steps to submit a bug:

1. Go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/Aemulo/Aemulo/issues).
2. Click on the "New Issue" button.
3. In the issue template, provide a brief, descriptive title for the bug.
4. In the body of the issue, provide a detailed description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, and the expected outcome.
5. Add appropriate labels such as "bug", "help wanted", or "good first issue". 
6. Submit the issue.

Remember, the more information you provide about the bug and how to reproduce it, the easier it will be for us to fix it!

## Bug Reports Guidelines

1. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
2. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. 
3. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. 
4. Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
5. Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
6. Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
7. If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
